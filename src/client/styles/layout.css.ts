  /* --- Phone chrome ---
     The system status bar stays visible (no fullscreen). Three adjustments
     make it behave:
     - touch-action: pan-y pinch-zoom kills double-tap-to-zoom (and the 300ms
       tap delay) while keeping vertical pan. Omitting pan-x (i.e. not using
       the manipulation alias) forbids HORIZONTAL pan on the root: a
       left-edge horizontal drag would otherwise be claimed by the browser as
       a pan (firing pointercancel) before the sidebar swipe layer can
       classify it. touch-action does not inherit and the behavior
       intersection stops at the first scroll container, so only touches
       landing directly on the root background are affected — inner
       horizontal scrolling of content containers is untouched. pinch-zoom is
       listed on purpose (#45): a bare pan-y also drops pinch, and then a
       zoom the browser applied by itself — iOS enlarges the viewport when a
       field under 16px takes focus — can no longer be undone by the user,
       so the app stays magnified until it is reopened or rotated. Two-finger
       zoom is also the WCAG 1.4.4 escape hatch and costs the gesture layer
       nothing: pinch is not a horizontal pan.
     - overscroll-behavior-x: none suppresses the browser's edge history
       navigation on the root scroller — Android Chrome claims a horizontal
       stroke that STARTS within its edge band (EDGE_WIDTH_DP=48dp,
       NavigationHandler.java) and navigates BACK, the exact gesture that
       opens the drawer ("页面直接返回上一页", 2026-08-29 user report). Only
       html/body count for this (Chromium issue 41483088: inner containers
       are ignored by the navigation path). iOS Safari's edge back-swipe has
       no CSS opt-out (WebKit bug 240183) — there the widened gesture start
       zone (START_ZONE_RATIO 0.45 of the viewport width, ~176px at 390px,
       past every browser's edge-claim strip) is the mitigation.
     - With the client's viewport-fit=cover, env(safe-area-inset-top) is the
       status bar / notch height; the rules below push the app content below
       it so the status bar never covers anything. Off notched phones (or in
       a normal browser tab where the layout viewport already sits below the
       status bar) the inset is 0 and nothing shifts. */

  /* AppFrame: the drawer takes the sidebar column out of grid flow, so the
     remaining in-flow items (center, details) land in tracks 1..2: give the
     center every pixel and keep the details track at zero. The top padding
     clears the status bar / notch for every in-flow surface (session header,
     messages, composer); the absolutely-positioned drawer is unaffected (its
     containing block is the frame's padding box, i.e. still the frame top).
     box-sizing MUST be border-box: the official frame is height:100% of a
     100%-height body, and it is content-box by default, so the safe-area
     padding is ADDED on top of the full viewport height. The frame then grows
     to 100% + inset, the document itself becomes scrollable by exactly the
     inset, and the sticky composer seat (bottom:0 of the scroll body) lands
     below the visual viewport. Symptoms on a notched phone: the whole UI can
     be swiped up, the composer lifts off the bottom leaving a blank strip,
     and the newest message sits under the composer because the host's
     at-bottom follow scrolls its own scroll body, not the document. With
     border-box the padding is taken out of the 100% height instead, so the
     frame is exactly one viewport tall and the document never scrolls.

     The leading html element selector is load-bearing, not decoration: the
     third-party @linxin666/dsh-web-all sheet ships an equal-specificity
     !important grid-template-columns for this same element under
     (max-width: 768px), so without the extra element the winner is decided by
     which sheet happens to be injected later. Measured before and after with
     scripts/probes/cascade-conflict-probe.mjs: no computed value moves, the
     rule only stops depending on sheet order (audit D-5 option A). */

     Closed state: translateX(-110%) — more than -100% of the max-content
     width — guarantees the whole drawer (and its shadow, had it one) leaves
     the viewport. A mere -100% leaves a sliver on screen; -105% (as used

       (the list stays 270px at every width and its right edge sits at 278, so
       270 and below cut into the list itself). At exactly 280 the panel is fully

  /* 0.1.6-alpha.2 宿主的插件管理页（dsh-client-ui-plugin-manager 渲染的
     section[data-plugin-panel]）。FAB 是全站恒定的左上角控件（用户明确
     要求：右下角不对，就放左上角），所以规则不做的是挪 FAB，做的是给
     详情页的宿主返回键让位：
     - 列表页：左上角没有任何宿主按键（实测热区为空），FAB 留在 base.css
       原位（top:12px left:10px）即唯一的可见入口，零规则。
     - 详情页（DetailTop 组件）：左上角是宿主返回键「返回插件列表」crumb，
       文字实测 [24,28,70,19]，与 FAB 盒 [10,12,38,38] 左半重叠——点
       「插件列表」会触发开抽屉而不是返回（2026-09-19 用户报障）。让
       crumb 整体右移 32px（左缘 24 → 56 = FAB 右缘 48 + 8px 间距），
       左上角变成「FAB 开目录 + crumb 返回」并排、各自可点。详情根的
       data-* 标记有三种：内置插件详情 data-plugin-item-detail、市场
       插件详情 data-plugin-row-detail、builtin 详情 data-plugin-detail
       （实测「智能体团队」卡走的就是第三种），三条选择器并列全覆盖。
       历史如下一版注释前文，所以第三版动的是宿主 crumb 而不是我方
       控件。锚点全部是宿主 data-* 标记，比 css-module 哈希类
       （X_2TxG_）稳定；pre-alpha.2 宿主没有这些标记，规则天然不命中
       （代际门控）。crumb 右移后 detailHead（icon+actions 在行尾）仍由
       flex 自行排布，390px 行宽充裕。 */
