  /* --- Phone chrome ---
     The system status bar stays visible (no fullscreen). Three adjustments
     make it behave:
     - touch-action: pan-y pinch-zoom kills double-tap-to-zoom (and the 300ms
       tap delay) while keeping vertical pan. Omitting pan-x (i.e. not using
       the manipulation alias) forbids HORIZONTAL pan on the root: a
       left-edge horizontal drag would otherwise be claimed by the browser as
       a pan (firing pointercancel) before the sidebar swipe layer can
       classify it. touch-action does not inherit and the behavior
       intersection stops at the first scroll container, so only touches
       landing directly on the root background are affected — inner
       horizontal scrolling of content containers is untouched. pinch-zoom is
       listed on purpose (#45): a bare pan-y also drops pinch, and then a
       zoom the browser applied by itself — iOS enlarges the viewport when a
       field under 16px takes focus — can no longer be undone by the user,
       so the app stays magnified until it is reopened or rotated. Two-finger
       zoom is also the WCAG 1.4.4 escape hatch and costs the gesture layer
       nothing: pinch is not a horizontal pan.
     - overscroll-behavior-x: none suppresses the browser's edge history
       navigation on the root scroller — Android Chrome claims a horizontal
       stroke that STARTS within its edge band (EDGE_WIDTH_DP=48dp,
       NavigationHandler.java) and navigates BACK, the exact gesture that
       opens the drawer ("页面直接返回上一页", 2026-08-29 user report). Only
       html/body count for this (Chromium issue 41483088: inner containers
       are ignored by the navigation path). iOS Safari's edge back-swipe has
       no CSS opt-out (WebKit bug 240183) — there the widened gesture start
       zone (96px, beyond every browser's edge-claim strip) is the
       mitigation.
     - With the client's viewport-fit=cover, env(safe-area-inset-top) is the
       status bar / notch height; the rules below push the app content below
       it so the status bar never covers anything. Off notched phones (or in
       a normal browser tab where the layout viewport already sits below the
       status bar) the inset is 0 and nothing shifts. */

  /* AppFrame: the drawer takes the sidebar column out of grid flow, so the
     remaining in-flow items (center, details) land in tracks 1..2: give the
     center every pixel and keep the details track at zero. The top padding
     clears the status bar / notch for every in-flow surface (session header,
     messages, composer); the absolutely-positioned drawer is unaffected (its
     containing block is the frame's padding box, i.e. still the frame top).
     box-sizing MUST be border-box: the official frame is height:100% of a
     100%-height body, and it is content-box by default, so the safe-area
     padding is ADDED on top of the full viewport height. The frame then grows
     to 100% + inset, the document itself becomes scrollable by exactly the
     inset, and the sticky composer seat (bottom:0 of the scroll body) lands
     below the visual viewport. Symptoms on a notched phone: the whole UI can
     be swiped up, the composer lifts off the bottom leaving a blank strip,
     and the newest message sits under the composer because the host's
     at-bottom follow scrolls its own scroll body, not the document. With
     border-box the padding is taken out of the 100% height instead, so the

     Closed state: translateX(-110%) — more than -100% of the max-content

  /* Compact session header rows (2026-09-14 phone report: the top is very
     empty). The host's own mobile sheet lays the header out as
     grid-template-rows: minmax(32px, auto) minmax(44px, auto) with
     [role="tab"] { min-height: 44px }, and both rows then grow to 44: the
     title row is floored by the empty utilities seat above, the tab row by the
     buttons' own floor. Measured at 390px: header 97px = 8 padding + 44 + 44 +
     1 border, for 36px of painted content. Capping the rows at 36/32 and the
     tabs at their own content height gives 77px, with nothing else degraded —
     title, mode text, status chips, chevrons and both pinned corner buttons
     keep their measured geometry, and the tab strip keeps its #41 contract
     (horizontal scroll, 16px gap, whole labels, pan-x).
     The host's 8px padding-top is deliberately kept: the title row's 28px
     content then centres at y=26, exactly the centre of the pinned corner
     controls (toggle and Files opener both sit at top:12, 28px tall). Trimming
     that padding to 4 shaved 4 more px but left the text row visibly riding
     above both buttons (2026-09-14 phone report: the text row sits too high
     against the drawer and Files controls), so the row height is what pays for
     the compaction, not the alignment.
     :has(> *) guards the hero header: it is an EMPTY, host-hidden grid that
     still occupies 85px while the composer is laid out under it. In the hero
     the header has 0 element children, so the guard leaves it at its official
     height — measured, the hero composer rect [0,349,388,231] is identical
     with and without this block. */

     Three tenants want the same row: the session title, the mode chip and the

     its aria-label, and the popover above now lists the jobs — so the job
     trigger's verbose label ("1 background job running") is what yields. The
     mode chip is the only mode switcher a phone has and the title is the only
     session identity, so both keep their words and the title ellipsizes
     instead (measured 2026-09-14 at 390px with a lineage chip present: after
     this the mode label keeps 101px of text and the crumb 135px).
     The lineage root (dsh-client-ui-subagent) sits in the crumbs for BOTH
     running and idle descendants, so the guards below key on that root rather
